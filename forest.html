<p id="verse">
Heart beatin' fast, let a ***** know that he alive<br>
Fake ***** mad, snakes in the grass let a ***** know that he arrive<br>
Don't be sleepin' on you lover cause its beauty in the struggle *****<br>
Goes for all y'all<br>
It's beauty in the struggle *****<br>
It's beauty in the struggle *****, ugliness in the success<br>
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress<br>
I grew up in the city and though some times we had less<br>
Compared to some of my ***** down the block man we were blessed<br>
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time<br>
But I be God damned if a ***** don't be tryin'<br>
So tell me mama please why you be drinking all the time?<br>
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?<br>
Cause pain still lingers on mine<br>
On the road to riches listen this is what you'll find<br>
The good news is ***** you came a long way<br>
The bad news is ***** you went the wrong way<br>
You think being broke is better
