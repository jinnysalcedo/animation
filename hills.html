<div id="happiness">
For what's money without happiness?<br>
Or hard times without the people you love?<br>
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next<br>
I asked for strength from the Lord up above<br>
'Cause I've been strong so far<br>
But I can feel my grip loosenin'<br>
Quick, do somethin' before you lose it for good<br>
Get it back and use it for good<br>
And touch the people how you did like before<br>
I'm tired of livin' with demons 'cause they always invitin' more<br>
Think being broke was better<br>
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect<br>
To all my ****** out there livin' in debt<br>
Cashin' minimal checks, turn on the TV see a ***** Rolex<br>
And fantasize about a life with no stress<br>
I mean this shit sincerely<br>
And as a ***** who was once in your shoes<br>
Livin' with nothin' to lose, I hope one day you hear me<br>
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but ***** feel me<br>
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly<br>
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got<br>
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock<br>
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours<br>
But you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours<br>
